# Use games between DAOs as a fun and engaging way to build a framework for many types of governance.

## Hypothesis: 
Governance has three major components:
1) Question formulation
1) Decision making economy 
    1) who gets votes
    1) how many votes do they get
    1) how often are decisions made
    1) are votes minted / burned or circulated like currency
    1) many other details
1) Decision making manifold (the specific mechanism for voting)

## Problem:
The easiest way to disrupt governance is to attack the framing of a question. This affects meatspace politics in addition to Ethereum governance. In Ethereum, this often looks like ad hominem attacks or demands for audits / guarantees / "proof".

## Problem:
Economics of decision making are not well studied; it's a new field.

## Proposed Solution:
Create a game played between DAOs that requires complex coordination among the members of a DAO.

Creating a game avoids all problems related to Question Formulation. If the game has a clear goal, there is little attack surface against the politics of the question itself.

The structure / rules of the game itself helps simplify many questions related to Decision Making Economy.

## Expected Outcome:
Creating a game should allow our community to rapidly surface use cases required in a proper toolchain for governance.

A continuous, long-lived game should provide a backdrop for experimentation - each DAO can choose any strategy for coordination and quickly test it. How do the members decide on a move? How does the DAO allocate resources? 

Over the long term, DAOs should be able to quickly iterate on strategies for coordination as they compete to win games. Winning strategies can then be applied toward real world use cases.

## Proposed outputs:
- A scalable game that can be played between two or more DAOs.
- An extremely simple interface to allow DAO members to begin playing the game.
- Robust APIs for DAOs to build more advanced / specific tools against.
- (possibly included) A very simple framework for DAO creation.
